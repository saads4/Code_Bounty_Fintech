Shreya, Inside this folder, I have added a trained ML model that performs real-time analysis and predicts whether to Buy, Sell, or Hold a stock.
Hereâ€™s how it works:
The user provides three inputs for each stock:
Stock name (ticker)
Buy price
Quantity
These inputs are stored in a portfolio.json file.
The recommend.py script uses the portfolio data along with latest stock prices and news sentiment to generate predictions using the trained ML model.
The output is a recommendation for each stock, telling the user whether they should Buy ðŸ“ˆ, Sell ðŸ“‰, or Hold ðŸ¤”.
So basically, the model combines historical price trends and market sentiment to give actionable advice on the userâ€™s portfolio.
